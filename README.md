Hey there, I'm Luaily!  
And I see you're my stalker? Because this GitHub has been dead for ages  
so the only reason you would be here would be to stalk me.  
Anywayyyy... I'm just your below average art student with some experience
in software development & scripting.

###

## Skills:
* **Graphic Design**, because I do this way more. You can view my work on Instagram.
* **Character Design**, I love drawing characters, even though I barely get to do that now. You can view my work on Instagram.
* **Music**, I can make music, somewhat, I'm definitely not good and I don't have time to improve yet.
* **Software/Scripting**, I develop stuff, it usually is barely functional but whatever.

## Languages I'm comfortable working in:
* **Lua** [Since 2018], it's in the name, mostly because I used to make roblox games, or exploited roblox games back when that was big thing.
* **Python** [Since 2019], *my most used language for a reason. I don't like the indents, or the stupid problems, but oh well, at least its legible.*
* **Java** [Since 2021], I used to make minecraft mods and clients, but this langauge is a headache.

### if you have a problem with any of my code, please message me or something.


## Opinions (mostly music related):
* Not every radio song is good, some of it is annoying trash, and theres always better stuff out there.
* I like older Kanye West (Graduation, Late Registration, College Dropout, etc.)
* ABC, **A**nything **B**ut **C**ountry, *except for Alan Jackson because my mom likes him alot.*
* Adding on to No. 1, same goes for TikTok music, it's very very hit or miss.
* Nirvana "fans" when you don't put on Smells Like Teen Spirit or Lithium.
  * I'm not saying they're bad songs, but thats just barely scratching the surface of their music.
* If you fw any of the following, I won't argue with you handsome/beautiful, whatever you say.
  * Nirvana (obviously), Foo Fighters, Metallica, Green Day, Led Zepplin, RHCP, Pink Floyd, and many more.
  * Lil Uzi Vert, Lucki, (old) Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar, 2Pac, NF (not let you down or the search, same situation as nirvana).
  * The Weeknd, but like the old songs from the first trillogy.
